    <p>The KTM 390 Duke and RC 390 are 373.2 cc (22.77 cu in) displacement single-cylinder engine motorcycles assembled by Bajaj Auto, and KTM Asia Motorcycle Manufacturing, Inc. (KAMMI) for the Austrian manufacturer KTM.[1] The bikes were developed under a joint program of Bajaj and KTM engineers, in which the concept was developed in Austria, while everything else, including design and final product development, was done in India by Bajaj.[7] The 390 Duke standard debuted at the 2012 EICMA show in Milan, Italy, and went on sale in India and the Philippines in 2013 and in the US in 2015.[6][8][9] The RC 390 sport bike was presented at EICMA the following year.[10] After the Duke's initial release, KTM CEO Stefan Pierer announced plans to export the 390 Duke to the US for 2014.[11][12] Bajaj said eventually the bike will be sold in 80 countries worldwide.[13]

        Pierer said in December 2015 that KTM and Bajaj plan to replace the 125, 200, and the 390-series Duke and RC lines in 2017, based on all new platforms, in part tarnavo meet Euro IV emissions standards, and to incorporate new technologies such as ride-by-wire.[14]
        
        390 Duke
        In its home market, the 390 Duke's engine size and weight place it in the mid-range category, and it sells for more than three times the average price of a motorcycle in India.[6][15] As one Indian reviewer put it "The 390 Duke may well be a simple little A2 license commuter for the European rider, but in the environs of Mumbai traffic, it's a proper rocket-powered scalpel."[16] In the US market, the same motorcycle is considered small-displacement, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive.[12] Similarly, the UK Sunday Times said, "Given that the 390 Duke weighs less than 150kg when it's full of fuel, you have to sit on it to stop it blowing away. It's as agile in traffic as a push-bike and whippet-thin," saying the bike was ideal for young riders with the A2 license, limited to 47 bhp (35 kW), who would find it easy to ride and confidence-inspiring, while feeling "fast and sporty".[2] Such a bike in the UK would also appeal to experienced riders looking for a practical and efficient commuter bike and runabout.[2] The 390 Duke won the 2013–14 Jury's Choice Bike of the Year in The Bloomberg TV India Autocar India Awards.[17] IndianCarsBikes said that with a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph) and a 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) time of 5.5 seconds, the 390 Duke is the fastest motorcycle made in India as of January 2014.[18]
        
        Motorcycle Consumer News tested the 390 Duke's top speed to be 167.4 km/h (104.0 mph), with acceleration from 0 to 97 km/h (0 to 60 mph) in 5.53 seconds, and 0 to 1⁄4 mi (0.00 to 0.40 km) in 14.02 seconds at 147.87 km/h (91.88 mph).[3] The brakes stopped the bike from 97 to 0 km/h (60 to 0 mph) in 43.1 m (141.3 ft), and fuel economy was tested at 3.97 L/100 km; 71.2 mpg‑imp (59.3 mpg‑US).[3] The 390 Duke weighed 153 kg (338 lb) wet and the engine power was 30.04 kW (40.29 hp) at 9,600 rpm, with 32.92 N⋅m (24.28 ft⋅lb) torque @ 7,000 rpm.[3] The brakes were considered to be "the most obvious flaw on the 390".[19]
        
        It has a kickstand sensor and switchable dual-channel ABS but no Cornering ABS, Combined ABS, traction control system, engine braking control, adaptive brake light, or cornering lights.
        
        As a feature, it has no keyless ignition but only optional immobiliser key and alarm system.
        
        2017 update
        After 2017, the 390 series' front brake disc was increased from 300 mm to 320 mm. The headlight was redesigned and converted to LED. The display became a color TFT panel with phone pairing capability. Seat height was increased from 800 mm (31.5 in) to 830 mm (32.7 in) and wheelbase was decreased 10 mm. The brake and clutch levers were also made manually adjustable.[20] The throttle now uses a ride by wire system and the tank was updated from 11 to 13.5 L (2.9 to 3.6 US gal).
        
        2018 update
        In 2018, KTM updated its Duke 390 with some minor changes, where it added a deflector plate on the left side of the chassis, to avoid exhaust heat near the riders leg.[21] The Duke 390 in India gained new features and updates. The Duke 390 comes with a daytime running light, and is on Euro IV emission standards.
        
        2020 update
        The bike was made BS6 compliant and a bi-directional quickshifter was added.
        
        2022 update
        3 new colors are available for the 2022 Duke, which was launched in Egypt at an ex-showroom price of ₹2.7 lakh (US$3,200).[22] In Austria, it was released at €6,749 (US$7,982.04).[23]</p>
